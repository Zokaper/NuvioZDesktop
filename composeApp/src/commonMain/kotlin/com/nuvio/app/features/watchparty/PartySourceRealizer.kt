/**
 * Process owner for party source work and for the sensitive launch it resolves.
 *
 * Every screen that used to own a piece of this lifetime lost it at the wrong moment. The launch
 * latch lived in the repository next to unrelated party state; the resolved launch lived in
 * `PlayerLaunchStore` behind three party-shaped methods; matching state existed only as local
 * composition variables inside a source route that is torn down the instant playback starts. Routes
 * may *present* this state and *consume* a ready realization, but none of them owns its lifetime.
 *
 * Everything is keyed by the exact authoritative party source identity
 * `(partyId, contentGeneration, sourceGeneration, descriptor)`. [updateAuthority] is the only way
 * that identity moves, and every other entry point is rejected unless it names the current one - so
 * work that finishes after the host changed the source cannot report into, or resolve for, the
 * party as it is now.
 *
 * The retained [PlayerLaunch] is process-local, never serialized, and never presented: it carries
 * resolved URLs and headers. Only the opaque realization ID leaves this object.
